# **Movement Services Update**

## August 1, 2025

Hey everyone—

We hope you’re staying safe and cool during this hot, hot Rhode Island summer.

The Movement Services team is hard at work continuing to build a suite of tools to help power our movement work over the summer and fall. We continue not just to build new tools, but also to iterate behind the scenes on boring-but-important data structures that will keep our records clean and our data safe, so you can focus on the important work of organizing.

### **🎉 Major updates**

1.  Emails emails emails
    

We’ve been working hard to make a polished, _consistent_ email digest for upcoming events, currently to be sent on Sundays. For now, the Calendar Digest will include all events for the coming week, although if more start coming in we may prioritize. As always, the best ways to stay updated on local events will be by [checking our calendar directly](https://mvsv.io/calendar) and by joining [our Signal thread](https://mvsv.io/signal). We look forward to your feedback!

2.  Updates about updates
    

We’re also launching our product update notes—you’re reading our first right now! To avoid spam, we currently plan product update emails only for major rollouts, like the coming launch of our calendar digest emails. These product updates will also include insights into other minor updates, and will give insights into new tools and improvements on the horizon.

### **🆕 Also shipped**

*   Improvements to our email collection and user tracking
    
*   Better ways to flag when an event needs a correction/cancelation
    
*   Set up “MS Link Sync”—URLs from Facebook, Eventbrite, Mobilize, and Action Network can now be pasted into [our calendar submission form](https://mvsv.io/add) for easier event submission
    
*   Various itsy bitsy bug fixes
    

### **🔧 In active development**

*   Organization pages for the MS website (e.g., show me all the bills RI Working Families Power focused on this year)
    
*   A consistent set of topic tags for issues, bills, and events
